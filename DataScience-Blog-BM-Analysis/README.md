Project Submissions for datascience nano degree program
## Project 1:
Boston Marathon Data Analysis
## Installation:
The code was run using Python3
## Project Motivation
Running is a sport that can be taken up at any age and attracts a diverse group of people. 
I downloaded the Boston Marathon Finishers Data set from Kaggle for years 2016,2017 and 2019. 
The Data sets include runners that completed the race.It has some basic demographic information and time taken to cross various milestones over the course of the run.
- What is the composition of Runners?
- What factors influence the race pace of a runner?
- Are we seeing overall improvement in race times yoy ?
- Are there noticeable changes in the paces of runners over the course of the marathon ?
## Requirements
The Code was run using Python 3
The following libraries have been used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
